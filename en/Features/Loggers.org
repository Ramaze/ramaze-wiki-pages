* Loggers

Available loggers:

  * LogHub
  * Informer
  * [[http://analogger.swiftcore.org/][Analogger]]
  * Syslog
  * [[http://lukeplant.me.uk/articles.php%3Fid%3D3][KNotify]]
  * [[http://www.ignavus.net/software.html][XOSD (now defunct?)]]


The default logger is the ''LogHub'' which supports all other loggers (including itself) and serves as a kind of redirection.
The default logger within ''LogHub'' is the ''Informer'', which prints nicely colored logs to stdout.

To simply store a copy of the logs in a file:

{{{ ruby
Ramaze::Log.loggers << Ramaze::Informer.new('inform.log')
}}}

For a faster, more flexible alternative, use the high performance [[http://analogger.swiftcore.org][Swiftcore Analogger]]

{{{ ruby
  Ramaze::Log.loggers = [Ramaze::Informer.new, Ramaze::Analogger.new('ramaze')]
}}}

To exchange the logger itself, just replace the ''Ramaze::Log'' constant:

{{{ ruby
  Ramaze::Log = Ramaze::Analogger.new('ramaze')
  # or without warning
  module Ramaze
    remove_const :Log
    Log = Analogger.new('ramaze')
  end
}}}
