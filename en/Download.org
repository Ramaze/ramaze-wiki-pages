* Download Ramaze

Note: For Windows users, you may also wish to install the win32console gem.
This will both satisfy the warning generated by ramaze as well as give you pretty colors when you run your server.

{{{
$ gem install win32console
}}}

** Using Rubygems

After following one of these instructions you can use the gem in your app:

{{{ ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'ramaze'
}}}

*** Install from rubyforge

The simplest way to get Ramaze is to use the [[http://rubygems.org][Rubygems]] package manager:

  $ gem install ramaze

*** Install from github

To get a more up-to-date version, as the rubyforge site isn't updated very often, you can install the gem directly from the git repository.

{{{
gem install manveru-ramaze --source=http://gems.github.com
}}}

** Using git

To get the latest Ramaze code from the git repository instead, read [[Contributing]].
